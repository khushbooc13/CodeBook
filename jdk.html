	<h3><b><dt>JVM</h3></b>
	<dd>JVM (Java Virtual Machine) is an abstract machine. It is a specification that provides runtime environment in which java bytecode can be executed.
JVMs are available for many hardware and software platforms. JVM, JRE and JDK are platform dependent because configuration of each OS differs. But, Java is platform independent.
The JVM performs following main tasks:
<ul>
	<li type="disc">Loads code
	<li type="disc">Verifies code
	<li type="disc">Executes code
	<li type="disc">Provides runtime environment
</ul>
